        <p>goddess is a female deity. Goddesses have been linked with virtues such as beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, and fertility.</p>
        <p>In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. For example, Shaktism, the worship of the female force that animates the world, is one of the three major sects of Hinduism.</p>
        <p>Polytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honor multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities.</p>
