                    <p>Hera: The Wife- A Symbol of Power: Associated titles and Power Words: The Empress, The Ruler, The
                    Wife, The
                    Matriarch, Worldly Power, tradition, marriage, partnership, and morality. Hera in Greek Mythology
                    was the wife of
                    Zeus, the Sky God, and thus her title was a grand one; The Goddess of Marriage and the Queen of the
                    Gods. Her
                    character was one of intensity. When she was happy in marriage or in the company of others, she
                    could be cordial and
                    gracious, yet if she was faced with betrayal on the part of Zeus, which was often the case, she
                    could be spiteful
                    and vicious. Whether expressing the graceful or disturbing aspect of her nature, she exemplified
                    determination and
                    strength.This archetype is applicable when questing for good solid relationships and partnerships
                    and when there is
                    a desire to create substantial committed and sacred unions with another. She would not be the
                    goddess most resonant
                    with breakups or divorces necessarily, though her archetypal influence empowers disentanglement from
                    unhealthy
                    relationships. She carries the quality of justice and is an archetype appropriate to moments of
                    challenging
                    corrupted authority. Historically, the Hera archetype was embodied by Queen Victoria in the 19th
                    Century.</p>

                    <p>Athena: The Career Woman- Symbol of Civilization: Associated symbols and power words: The Careerist,
                    The Competitor,
                    The Rebel, education, city culture, intellect, and logic. Athena, though known as the War Goddess,
                    is also famed for
                    her wisdom, artistry, and technical skills. Her unusual 'birth' story involved her father Zeus's
                    fear that she may
                    be another child to try to overthrow his power, and he, therefore, swallowed her mother Metis so
                    that she would not
                    give birth.Athena, however, was born instead out of Zeus's head. At birth, the myth holds that she
                    was a fully
                    formed adult clad in complete war gear. She is remarkably intelligent and fierce, with no fear of
                    taking on enemies.
                    Athena is a fierce warrior woman, independent of the approval or support of men. The energy of the
                    Athena archetype
                    would accept is one who would be able to stay abreast of her high ambitions and quest to live life
                    for a higher
                    purpose. For this purpose, the Athena archetype cannot be hindered. When a woman finds herself
                    pursuing career
                    success or a vision for a lofty life mission for her community or humanity at large, she could be
                    said to have found
                    herself in the Athena archetype. Psychologically, Athena archetype is often revealed in
                    personalities or phases
                    characterized by executives and competitive players, not in competition with the masculine, per se,
                    but holding the
                    belief that she is as smart and strong or stronger and as good or better a leader as men. Women
                    expressing the
                    Athena archetype will often be those wearing expensive or name brand suits and clothing. She will
                    tend to marry for
                    power more than an emotional connection, and this archetype may express as a lack of interest in
                    children or a lack
                    of desire for having children. The focus is primarily on business and politics. Historically, the
                    Athena archetype
                    was exemplified in Joan of Arc.</p>

                    <p>Aphrodite: The Lover- Symbol of Desire and Eros. Associated symbols and power words: The Patroness,
                    The Lover,
                    sexuality, body as a sacred temple, sensuality, romance, beauty, eros, passion, and the arts. The
                    Goddess of Love,
                    Aphrodite, was born from the foam of the sea. She is celebrated for her beauty and desirability and
                    yet is
                    ironically forced to marry the Blacksmith God, who is an unsightly man. Aphrodite and her husband
                    are Greek versions
                    of "Beauty and the Beast." Aphrodite, however, found love in the arms of a myriad men. She is
                    desired by many as
                    love, and her mere attention was said to break down emotional walls, creating intimacy and
                    vulnerability.
                    Aphrodite's energy is transformational; her power allows her to transmute anything into love. She
                    values a genuine
                    connection between people and is willing to explore intimacy while maintaining independence.
                    Aphrodite's archetypal
                    influence can be seen in those women who are looking for love, desiring to live life through the
                    heart, or to those
                    women who feel especially called to experience sex as a sacred and spiritual act, full of
                    vulnerability and
                    playfulness. Her archetype stands to assist the deepening of relationships and to aid women
                    embarking on creative
                    projects. She brings healing to relationships and love related trauma. Historically, Aphrodite was
                    represented by
                    Cleopatra.</p>

                    <p>Persephone: The Seer- Symbol of the Underworld and the UnconsciousAssociated symbols and power words:
                    The Medium, The
                    Seer, intuition, clairvoyance, transformation, endings and death, dreaming, inner guidance, shadow
                    work, healing,
                    and psychic powers. Greek Goddess of the Underworld, Persephone, is the daughter of Zeus and
                    Demeter. While still in
                    her youth, she was kidnapped by Hades, God of Death. It is said that when Persephone ate pomegranate
                    seeds in the
                    underworld, it forever tied her identity to that pace. A deal was made, and Persephone stayed with
                    Hades for the six
                    cold months. Because of her connection to the underworld, Persephone is associated with all things
                    occult in nature.
                    This is including the world of spirits, mysticism, and death itself. She views everything in life
                    through the veil
                    of spirituality. Trapped in the darkness of the underworld, she became connected to the collective
                    unconscious and
                    an archetypal guide for shadow work and the laborious task of a woman facing her inner demons. The
                    Persephone
                    archetype endeavors to transcend the station of the victim and to begin the journey to
                    self-knowledge and
                    –empowerment. Psychologically, Persephone's archetypal threads can be most clearly seen in women
                    coming from overly
                    strict upbringings with overbearing parents. Perhaps as girls and young women, they struggled to
                    make independent
                    decisions or saying no to others. They aim to please others and are often innocent, pretty, and
                    naïve.
                    Simultaneously, they possess incredible minds and capacities for creativity, being deeply
                    imaginative, poetic,
                    artistic daydreamers who find fascination with the mystical. A Persephone type energy is the
                    potential for a great
                    many outcomes offered by a myriad of talents, but they need to pin down precisely what it is they
                    desire. Persephone
                    personifies dying to the old self and beginning to be reborn anew, sometimes over and over again.
                    She is a phoenix
                    rising from the ashes. Once matured, this archetype develops the strength and wisdom characterized
                    by her tempering
                    through many challenges. She can serve as a guiding light for others to do the same, letting go of
                    fears, defining
                    her own self, and living in the full flow of life. Her interest in esoteric studies and magic tends
                    to develop and
                    grow with age. Historically, the Persephone archetype came to life through Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a
                    famous Swiss-
                    American psychiatrist who pioneered studies on death and dying.</p>

                    <p>Artemis: Associated symbols and power words: The Shamaness, The Huntress, adventures, wilderness,
                    nature, and the
                    animal world. The Greek Goddess of the Hunt, Artemis, was another of Zeus's unplanned children.
                    Wanting to hide her
                    true connection to him, Zeus turned her mother, Leto, into a quail who then laid Artemis in an egg.
                    Artemis'
                    unusually mythic birth from an egg hints to her legendary association with nature, the forest, and
                    the animal
                    kingdom. As a small child, Artemis ran away into the wild and began hunting with a band of women who
                    gave vows of
                    chastity. Although she hunted, she maintained profound care for animals. The Artemis archetype is
                    most resonant with
                    activism- particularly animal rights. Still, she appears in those women who find in their nature a
                    rebel, an animal
                    lover, and a nature lover or environmentalist. Psychologically, Artemis is an independent woman, and
                    in myths, she
                    is not depicted as being reliant on men. She possesses the ability to seize what she desires out of
                    life without the
                    need to question her own desires. In step with her ambitious nature, she is athletically built,
                    dresses in attire,
                    which will permit her to move swiftly, and she will only choose a suitor who can run alongside her.
                    With a deep
                    personal need for her freedom and the need to conquer her goals, her romantic partnerships are based
                    on friendship
                    and playful competition more than emotions. Artemis is kindhearted with a desire to help women,
                    animals, and the
                    planet. Historically, Artemis is embodied by the beloved Jane Goodall.</p>

                    <p>Demeter: The Mother Symbol of Ancestral Wisdom. Associated symbols and power words: The Mother, The
                    Daughter, The
                    Earth Mother, The Grandmother' childbearing, fertility, generational wisdom, and nurture.The Greek
                    Agriculture
                    Goddess Demeter is a kind introverted soul who loves to nurture others, most especially children.
                    She exudes
                    motherly love toward anyone in need of it. She is a natural caretaker and her symbolism extends to
                    human fertility,
                    nature, and the earth. Psychologically, the archetype of Demeter speaks to the love of women for
                    their children or
                    the children whose lives they touch. A decision shaped by the Demeter archetype would be choosing a
                    partner with the
                    primary desire to procure a family. A woman expressing this archetype may be extraordinarily
                    nurturing and may
                    attract others who were deprived of motherly love. Generally, this aspect of the psyche needs to
                    learn to receive as
                    well as she knows how to give, protecting her tendency to give away energy too freely. This type of
                    personality may
                    excel at sometimes providing even try to save others but must learn to also prioritize herself.
                    Women who have this
                    archetype dominant in their character or life path may find success as doctors, psychologists, or
                    any caretaking
                    professions. Historically, the Demeter archetype was embodied by Mother Teresa.</p>
